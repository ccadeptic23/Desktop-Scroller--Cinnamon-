Configuration options on configuration page
===========================================
Change whether arrows appear when switching desktops
Change the width of activation arrows
Change visibility of activation areas
* Change positions and height/width of activation areas


Configuration options in the metadata.json
==========================================
You can change the icons that appear when switching Desktops.
Place the icons you want to use in the local directory for the extension.
Usually ~/.local/share/cinnamon/extensions/desktop-scroller@ccadeptic23 or /usr/share/cinnamon/extensions/desktop-scroller@ccadeptic23
These should be properly formatted images.
Then change the entries in the metadata.json file
  "switchPrevIcon": "my-go-prev.svg",
  "switchNextIcon": "my-go-next.svg"
To the filenames for the icons that you want to use.


Known issues
============
*If you scroll too fast the arrow's direction doesnt change, but once it fades the next time we are ok.
